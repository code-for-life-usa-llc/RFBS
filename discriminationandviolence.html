             <h1 class="one">Discrimination And Violence</h1>
        <p class="mma">There is much discrimination and violence that has already been passed through most of the world already. 
             Multiple shootings in the U.S. just for something silly or not of value. Many also argue for dumb reasons,
             especially in indian and muslim culture. Like an incident that happened before while expressing religious beliefs.
             A group of about 30 people attacked dozens of churchgoers, including women and children, and the church's pastor. Satpal Bhati, the pastor, said
             the,"August 20th assault", on the Protestant church in northeastern Delhi took place less than 10 miles from where world leaders
             including President Joe Biden will meet this week for the annual summit of the Group of 20 economies.
             “They came straight inside and started beating up people. They broke a chair, tore our Bible, busted the drums, and beat the kid's hand with a rod,” Bhati said.
             “They said, 'This can't go on, you can't do this, this is a Hindu nation,’” he added.

            <p class="ee">Just from the story alone, you can see what people have to go through from time to time. It's horrible.
                Many people, alone, die from discriminatory violence against their race or gender. Even both sometimes.
                <br>
             <h2 class="tw">Discrimination in 2022</h2>
             <p class="ww"> There are hundreds-- if not, thousands, of discriminatory violence cases which are not looked upon. Most cases are left alone,
                which just causes more cases to pop up. Though, they never get solved. Violence is already a giant problem in the world with the US
                which is 369.8% in 2022. The US and Venezuela even top the charts of countries with the most prisoners and or violent people.
                There were also 21,156 homicide cases in the US in 2022, which were <strong>males</strong> and <strong>African American.</strong>
             </p>
            <h2 class="rr">Violence In New York</h2>
            <p class="tt">There is much violence going on in New York, and multiple shootings. Just like the one that happened at Randall's Park, a migrate shelter. Two people got injured, but unfortuantely a woman had died on impact. </p>
                <img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/police-ems-seen-parking-field-86334534.jpg?w=1024" class="img" width="550" height="309">
             <p class="yy">
                This is a big problem in New York; hundreds- if not, thousands, of shootings for such stupid reasons which could've been resolved in a few simple words.
                Since the situation wasn't even that bad but still ended up in a  bloody mess, as shown in the picture with the multiple dispatch officers as well
                 as the amublance blaring in the background of the bloody scene.
